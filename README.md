## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills and projects in both UI/UX design and Software Engineering. The website features an interactive React background for a dynamic user experience and is styled using React Bit UI. It serves as a central hub to explore my design concepts (presented via Figma) and my software development projects (linked from GitHub). The website is built using a modern full-stack JavaScript architecture.
